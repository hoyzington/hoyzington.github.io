One day soon I’ll be on a team, working on a website. Version control will be key to our efficiency. And it all comes down to good, frequent commits. I haven’t had the experience yet of picking up where someone else left off, and trying to get up to speed by looking at their messages. But I’m sure that when that time comes, it will become crystal clear to me just how lacking my own history of version control use has been!

I think that with my first Flatiron project, I had completed at least a third of it before even remembering that I was supposed to be commiting. And since then, with each project, I have been striving to make more and better commits. The biggest obstacle I keep encountering is my own flow state—hours of solid coding. The world around me disappears. I vanquish one bug after another. It’s like I’m playing a sport with no time outs. Nonstop. For every challenge there’s an idea to try, or a solution to be found online.

And then I see all those changes to all those files! I have to document all that work—it’s overwhelming.

One of my problems is that I see multiple issues in my code, or things that could be refactored, and I have been just fixing those along with the main thing I was doing. So very quickly I have files with several or many unrelated changes. I’ve come to realize that’s bad practice! In fact, that approach may have been hampering all kinds of previous efforts in my life. But now I’m learning to resist that urge and instead make notes in my NOTES.md file so I can make those changes later; and to also remember that whatever refactoring opportunity I see now, I'll also see later when it’s time to refactor. I’m still working on this, retraining myself. But along the way, what can I do when I look behind me and see that slew of undocumented work?

Watching the Flatiron videos of various instructors building websites has been just as important for my learning as the lessons and labs. But the truth is, those instructors are also usually forgetting to commit, because not only are they programming, they are also teaching a group of students and fielding their questions and trying to fit it all into the time allotted. Some of them don’t commit at all, but simply say, “and remember to commit often!”

But during this final project, I was watching the Globetrotter series made by Howard D., and he did something that has improved my Git performance greatly I think. At one point, he realized that he had done a lot of work without committing. But instead of doing what I had always done—adding all the files and making one or more vague blanket statements as the message—he did this:

First he didn’t panic like I and probably many other newbies do. Instead he used the git status command to see the list of new and changed files. Then he went one by one, adding and making a commit for each file or small group of files that represented a particular accomplishment. I’m a little embarrassed to say this was an epiphany for me. I then remembered navigating folders and files of repositories on GitHub. Each file had it’s own latest commit message. Many would show the same message, as they were all included in one commit. But that didn’t mean I couldn’t add and commit files individually, so that at least that unrelated change I made isn’t mentioned for a whole bunch of files that don’t even have that change.

So of course I’m still trying to commit as I go, but when I realize that I haven’t been, I do what Howard did. I also quickly look over each changed file for the indicators that VSCode shows me, clicking on them if necessary to see what I did. And I’ve learned to sometimes write the commit message before adding the file if there are multiple changes, because once you add the file, the change notations disappear! When you try to commit before adding, you get an error message followed by an updated list of uncommitted files. Rather than feeling chastised by this error, I exploit it. I copy the file path from the list and paste it onto my add command and then hit enter. Then I use the up arrow to recall the commit command from earlier and execute it. The improvement with all this is that changes are only mentioned for the specific files that have them; and each file has more explicit documentation. A huge step for me on my journey.

There are several other little things I’ve learned to do, which are harder to explain than to understand. And my future self will have all but abandoned these tricks. For now I consider them to be like training wheels, or some other type of temporary transitional aid along to way to more professional use of version control. The interesting thing about these training wheels—what gave me the confidence to write here about them—was the simple fact that since using them, I’m actually somehow remembering to commit more often! Maybe it’s because I’m losing a subconscious dread of version control.

I still make some lame commits, but I’m getting better all the time.
