I was pretty naive going into my first portfolio project, a CLI data gem. I felt ready. And as I saw the messages on Slack from the early beginners, to be honest, I wondered what all the fuss was about. I guessed that maybe their projects were too ambitious. And of course there are the never-ending sagas of those who have chosen to use a local IDE before the time that Flatiron recommends. Thanks to those people, I'm absolutely dreading that process which must soon commence for me, now that I have completed this first portfolio project.

We were given a week, even though the process should have taken only three days (and in spite of the multiple videos of cohort leads completing this project in a little over an hour!). Nevertheless, here I am, on the evening of the due date, completing the last part of this project as I write this blog post.

I wanted to spend last weekend just watching Learn.co videos in preparation, but instead had to play catch up with my lessons and lab assignments. I had been a full day ahead at the beginning of that week, but after a surprise visit from my daughter, and getting stuck on those last two labs, I had gotten two days behind. Then I learned from my wife, a Filipina who's waiting for her U.S. visa, that a volcano had just erupted 50 miles from her and there were also earthquakes! She wasn't hurt, but it's stressful because experts say the worst is yet to come, and this has been quite disruptive to the whole region.

But as to my project, no worries--this was a three-day project! I could still spend Monday watching videos and have plenty of time to finish.

The main things I learned from this experience had little to do with coding. In fact the coding was somewhat of an oasis in the midst of all the unexpected. I only wish I'd had more time to refactor before submitting.

I'm one of those bootcamp students with virtually no previous experience or knowledge related to programming before I started the Flatiron prep course. I had begun Harvard's CS50 course online; but that was only weeks before applying for bootcamp. So it was all those extra programming-related tasks that ate up my time: Github, Rubygems.org, Zoom, Bundler, gemspec, screen recording, posting to youtube, etc. I had never done that that stuff before. I watched hours of videos looking for those few moments that would inform the situation of my particular gem.

And then in the midst of all this, I was struck with my first ever bout of vertigo! I thought I was having a stroke or heart attack. Come to find out, this runs in my familly on both sides but they never really talked about it. Thanks family.

So this blog post is obviously not a technical one describing my code. For me (and I'd dare say, for many beginners who are not those youngsters just out of high school taking four years to learn this stuff in college) the main obstacles to becoming programmers are not the coding concepts and the languages (as challenging as they are!). It's life that gets in the way. And it's all those programming-related tasks that we've never done before. Or maybe never even done anything like them before. And it's also having to learn how to learn outside of class.

I'm glad I kept my project simple and basic. I just needed to get this first one behind me. And I needed to learn that with God's help, I can overcome all these obstacles and others that come my way. That's how I will become a programmer.
