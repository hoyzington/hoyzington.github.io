During an earlier project I decided to use Bootstrap to style my website. It was a frustrating experience. The framework seemed mysterious and magical, and the more I tried to work with it, the more of a mess my project became. So for the next project I decided to avoid styling, because it wasn’t required. I added just a little CSS.

For this project I really wanted to make a good website, but I didn’t want the frustrations I experienced in Bootstrap, and I didn’t expect any other framework to be a better experience. I decided to write my own CSS. The file grew and grew; and even after refactoring, it was a pretty large CSS file—at least compared to what I was expecting. I felt a little guilty doing so much styling without a framework—like I was “re-inventing the wheel”.

But I’m proud of that file. And I loved the learning experience. Playing around and experimenting with CSS was just what I needed. And surprisingly, the things I recalled from Bootstrap now make more sense, even though it was months ago that I tried using it.

I’m now ready and eager to use Bootstrap for my next and final project, and then maybe to add Materialize to my previous project that lacks styling. Sometimes you have to “re-invent the wheel” in order to better understand it.
