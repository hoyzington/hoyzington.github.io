I am a late bloomer. And I'm just beginning to bloom. I've known for many years what my difficulties were; I just didn't know how to overcome them. Two that I'm overcoming with the help of Flatiron are perfectionism and fear of failure. I would have thought that a software engineering bootcamp would *not* be helpful at all in learning how *not* to be perfectionist and how *not* to fear failure! But fortunately life has some pleasant surprises.

At this point, it doesn't really matter how I came to have these weaknesses. And I won't insult your intellegence or accumulated knowledge by describing or explaining them either. And I think we've all heard advice on how to combat these tendencies. But here's the advice I got from Avi Flombaum during one of his technical training videos. It has really made a difference for me.

*"Just get it working. Then refactor it."* He thought he was speaking only about writing code.
 
How many minutes and hours and years have I wasted paralyzed in the middle of my projects and life goals because I knew I wasn't doing them well enough? *"Just get it working."* is permission to be imperfect. And rather than going down the rabbit hole of asking myself, "Is this good?" every few minutes as I build, I now ask myself the more useful question, "Does this work?" It doesn't even have to work well! Not at first. And once I have a "working copy," refactoring is now a more sane pursuit of "doing it well".

I have to admit I am still battling some psychological resistance to this idea of starting with a quick and dirty, merely functioning version of what I'm trying to do, and to only then focus on excellence. It would seem more efficient and graceful and respectable to just be excellent from the very first step I take. Certainly. But in 50 years, I've never been able to do that.

Of course, the refactoring process should not be never-ending. So how do I know when a project is good enough? For now at least, I have to seek input from others--from teachers, mentors, colleagues, and managers (but not from my rubber duck).
