Is there anyone, really, who's still asking this question?

Software programming/developing/engineering has now become an obvious choice if you're looking for a new career. I have a more important question: Why, when I get sick and tired of this extremely challenging and frustrating learning process, will I never give up? That is a crucial question for me to answer.

Here's today's answer.

I got so bent out of shape over the digital impasse I was facing this morning. I had tried everything. It's not easy for me to ask for help, but I did. And still no success. I spent hours getting nowhere, feeling somehow abused by this whole pursuit. And yes, once again, wondering if I'm really cut out for this. I had grown pessimistic, predicting the failure of every new idea that I nevertheless tried.

And then the tests passed.

And to be honest I was still angry. I still felt indignant and abused by code. In that moment, at least for me, the promise of money and respect and security and life/work flexibility, were not comforting to me. There was no comforting me.

Yes, 20 minutes later I was all better. Why? And why do I know I will not give up next time either? Like tomorrow? And for the rest of my career?

Because that's what it's like when you have finally found something (or someone) you truly love. You just know. I can't really explain it, I wish I could. But I thank God I get to experience it in this lifetime.
